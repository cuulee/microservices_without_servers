# Microservices Without Servers

Welcome 😎

This repository contains resources from my conference talk about building serverless applications.

Slides for the talk are available here:  [https://speakerdeck.com/jthomas/microservices-without-servers](https://speakerdeck.com/jthomas/microservices-without-servers). 

There's a transcript for the talk in [transcript.md](transcript.md).

Code samples used during the talk, with usage instructions, are available under the [code](code) directory. Video recordings for the demonstrations can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0UyhC0D6KABYPvGroXcIeE-4x_yEbdB4).

**If you have any questions or comments, feel free to raise an issue or send me a tweet ([@thomasj](https://twitter.com/thomasj)).**

## Abstract

*Servers are killing your productivity. Rather than building better software for your users, you end up constantly distracted by maintaining computers. Wasn't the "cloud" supposed to fix this? It sounded so promising until we realised it was just renting VMs in someone else's datacenter. We couldn't escape "servers". Until now...*

*In this session, developers will learn how to build microservices without servers, using modern “serverless” cloud platforms. We’ll look at common challenges (and solutions) to building applications using “serverless” stacks. Exploring emerging “serverless” design patterns will give developers the knowledge to build application architectures using these new platforms.*

*This session is aimed at software developers experienced in building traditional backend web applications, who want to learn how to build microservices without servers.*
